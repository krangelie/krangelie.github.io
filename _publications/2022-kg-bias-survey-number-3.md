**Abstract:** Knowledge graphs are increasingly used in a plethora of downstream tasks or in the augmentation of statistical models to improve factuality. However, social biases are engraved in these representations and propagate downstream. We conduct a critical analysis of literature concerning biases at different steps of a knowledge graph lifecycle. We investigate factors introducing bias, as well as the biases that are rendered by knowledge graphs and their embedded versions afterward. We discuss the limitations of existing measurement and mitigation strategies and propose paths forward.
