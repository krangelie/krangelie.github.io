**Abstract:** Social media platforms provide a continuous stream of real-
time news regarding crisis events happening on a global scale. Several
machine learning methods utilize the crowd-sourced data for the auto-
mated detection of crises and the characterization of their precursors
and aftermaths. Early detection and localization of crisis-related events
can help save lives and economies. Yet, the applied automation meth-
ods introduce ethical risks worthy of investigation â€” especially given
their high-stakes societal context. This work identifies and critically ex-
amines ethical risk factors of social media analyses of crisis events focus-
ing on machine learning methods. We aim to sensitize researchers and
practitioners to the ethical pitfalls and promote fairer and more reliable
designs.
