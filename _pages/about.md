Hi there!

I am a doctoral student in the [Semantic Systems](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/sems/home.html) group at the University of Hamburg. 

My main research interests are fairness and societal biases in natural language processing and knowledge graphs. I did a Master's in AI and previously completed Bachelor degrees in both Psychology (University of Mannheim) and Computer Science (University of Bremen). This background strongly influences how I approach problems -- motivated to conduct socially relevant research and to do social scientific theories justice.

I also co-founded the Hamburg-based start-up [AdaLab](https://adalab.ai/). We help research institutes and companies realize machine learning solutions.

Besides many other things, I love painting and drawing (checkout my insta), arts and crafts in general, and reading fiction that deals with feminist ideas or minority voices. 


# News

My Master's thesis recently won "Best student project" at the Informatics Department of the University of Hamburg. Here is a little [news item](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home/news/202110-expo.html) about it. Read my thesis [here](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/teaching/theses/completed-theses/2021-ma-kraft.pdf) (code can be found on my github).

On March 23, 2022, I had the honor of giving the valedictorian address at my graduation ceremony and was awarded as best student of the year across Master's courses in the computer science department.
