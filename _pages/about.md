Hi!

I'm a PhD student at the [Semantic Systems](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/sems/home.html) group at Uni Hamburg. 

My main research interests are fairness and societal biases in natural language processing and knowledge graphs. My interdisciplinary background in CS, ML, and psychology strongly influences how I approach problems -- motivated to conduct socially relevant research and to do social scientific theories justice.

I also co-founded the Hamburg-based start-up [AdaLab](https://adalab.ai/). We help research institutes and companies realize machine learning solutions.

Besides many other things, I love painting and drawing (checkout my insta), arts and crafts in general, and reading fiction that deals with feminist ideas or minority voices.
