I'm a doctoral candidate and researcher at the [Semantic Systems](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/sems/home.html) group at Uni Hamburg. My supervisors are Prof. Ricardo Usbeck and Prof. Judith Simon. 

My main research interests are societal biases and factuality in language models. My interdisciplinary background in CS, ML, and psychology strongly influences how I approach problems -- motivated to conduct socially relevant research and to do social scientific theories justice.
