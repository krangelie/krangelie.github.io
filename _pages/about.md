# About me

I recently started out as a doctoral student in the [Semantic Systems](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/sems/home.html) group of the University of Hamburg. 

My main research interests are fairness and societal biases in natural language processing and knowledge graphs. My Master's studies focused on AI. I have Bachelor degrees in Psychology (University of Mannheim) and Computer Science (University of Bremen). My interdisciplinary background strongly influences how I approach problems -- motivated to conduct socially relevant research and to do social scientific theories justice.

During my Master's studies, I co-founded [AdaLab](https://adalab.ai/). We help research institutes and companies realize machine learning solutions. We also love to play around with AI-generated art.

Besides many other things, I love painting and drawing (checkout my insta), arts and crafts in general, and reading fiction that deals with feminist ideas or minority voices. 

This side is WIP -- will be adding more details soon.
