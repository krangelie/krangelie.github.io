I presented a poster on my Master's thesis "Triggering Models: Measuring and Mitigating Bias in German Language Generation" at the yearly EXPO of the Informatics Department at the University of Hamburg. I won ["Best student project 2021"](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home/news/202110-expo.html).
