I was invited to present our work "The Ethical Risks of Analyzing Crisis Events on Social Media with Machine Learning" at the D2R2'22 workshop in Leipzig. Although I sadly could not give the talk due to sickness, my slides can be found [here](https://dataweek.de/slides/2022-07-06-d2r2-22-programm-talk-3.pdf).
